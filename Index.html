                <h1>Addis Ababa</h1>
                <p>Addis Ababa (/ˌædɪs ˈæbəbə/;[5]Amharic: አዲስ አበባ, lit. 'new flower' [adˈdis ˈabəba] ⓘ) is the capital and largest city of Ethiopia.[6][7][8] In the 2007 census, the city's population was estimated to be 2,739,551 inhabitants.[2] Addis Ababa is a highly developed[9] and important cultural, artistic, financial and administrative center of Ethiopia. It is widely known as one of Africa's capitals.[10]

                    The founding history of Addis Ababa dates back to the late 19th century by Menelik II, Negus of Shewa, in 1886 after finding Mount Entoto unpleasant two years prior.[11] At the time, the city was a resort town; its large mineral spring abundance attracted nobilities of the empire and led them to establish permanent settlement. It also attracted many members of the working classes – including artisans and merchants – and foreign visitors. Menelik II then formed his imperial palace in 1887.[12][13] Addis Ababa became the empire's capital in 1889, and subsequently international embassies were opened.[14][15] Urban development began with the 20th century, without any prior planning.[11]</p>
